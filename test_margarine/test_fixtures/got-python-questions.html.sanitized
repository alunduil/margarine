    EDITOR'S NOTE: Update: We got some great feedback about the first AMA with
    Jesse, so we're moving the discussion space for Alex's AMA from the Community
    to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/rackspace">http://reddit.com/r/rackspace</a>
    – that way it will be easier to follow the conversation and replies. In
    addition, we're tightening up the timeframe – the AMA will happen on Tuesday
    ONLY, and not Tuesday through Thursday as originally planned. Finally, some
    of the other devs who work with Alex will be lending a helping hand, so
    there will be plenty of developer experience on tap for everyone! Hope to
    see you all there next Tuesday!
    </p>

    <p>
    We know technical questions come up from time to time; questions that may
    require a pretty in-depth response. That's why next week we're launching a
    new Ask-Me-Anything three-day event series in partnership with the
    <a href="https://community.rackspace.com">Rackspace Community</a>. It's your
    opportunity to ask ANY development question you like and solicit feedback
    from Rackspace experts and others in the field. Ok, maybe not any
    development question: for this series of virtual events we're focusing
    mainly on Python.
    </p>

    <p>
    At Rackspace, we are fortunate to have the best and brightest in the Python
    community keeping us at the cutting edge, and they want to share some of
    their expertise and experience with our Community members!<!--More-->
    </p>

    <p>
    Each month, a Racker Python expert will open a post for questions and reply
    to every (reasonable!) question asked on that post, over the course of three
    days. Technical questions might require some additional sourcing, so we
    encourage you to check back often on the post and your question.
    </p>

    <p>
    Mark your calendars for August 6 through August 8 and join us for the first
    session with Jesse Noller. We have Alex Gaynor and Ed Leafe lined up to 
    participate in the months following. We hope you can benefit from the
    conversations over the next few months.
    </p>
