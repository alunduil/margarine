Introduction
============

I can't believe it's not butterâ€¦margarine aims to be a zen (butter) web
browsing experience.  This tool adds features to an amalgamation of delicious,
the social bookmarking application, and readability, the excellent web article
renderer.

Motivations
===========

This project was created as a demo application for training purposes on cloud
application design.  It is not intended (but no one will be stopped) as a
replacement for delicious and readability.

Scope
=====

The following features are the large scale goals of margarine:

* Social Bookmarking
* Tagged Bookmarks
* Re-rendering of Bookmarks
* URL Shortening of Bookmarks
* Margin Notations on Bookmarks

Not all of these scope goals will be available in what will be marked a first
release.

Deployment
==========

Margarine has several coordinating applications that get installed and need to
be running in order to provide all of the intended functionality:

:mapid:     The API daemon that provides the web service with the application
            logic and connects the frontend to the backend processors.
:margarine: The frontend for margarine that provides the web browseable
            interface to the application.
:spread:    The backend daemon process that does non-interactive processing.

The ``mapid`` process can be deployed as a WSGI service if desired (it is 
written with flask) but also has a built in web service that can be used for 
small or development deployments.

The ``spread`` daemon is designed to work with ``start-stop-daemon`` to run in
the background on a server.  The ``spread`` daemon listens to a configurable 
message queue but can be configured to talk directly with the ``mapid`` 
process.

Installation
============

The installer simply installs all the pieces with the current build system but
future work shall include splitting these up into separate bundles.  Due to the
single installer, installation is very easy:

:source: ``python setup.py install``
:pip:    ``pip install margarine``
