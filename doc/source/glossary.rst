    :ab testing: A/B testing or bucket testing is a method of marketing testing
                 by which a baseline control sample is compared to a variety of
                 single-variable test samples in order to improve response
                 rates.
    :api:        application programming interface—specifies how some software
                 components should interact with each other. In practice, an
                 API is often a library that includes specifications for
                 routines, data structures, object classes, and variables.

                 An API specification can take many forms, including an
                 International Standard such as POSIX, vendor documentation
                 such as the Microsoft Windows API, the libraries of a
                 programming language, e.g., Standard Template Library in C++
                 or Java API. Web APIs are also a vital component of today's
                 web fabric. An API differs from an application binary
                 interface (ABI) in that an API is source code based while an
                 ABI is a binary interface. For instance POSIX is an API, while
                 the Linux Standard Base is an ABI.
    :api key:    a code generated by websites that allow users to access their
                 application programming interface. API keys are used to track
                 how the API is being used in order to prevent malicious use or
                 abuse of the terms of service.
