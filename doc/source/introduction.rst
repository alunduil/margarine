Introduction
============

.. What is the purpose and goal of this documentation?

Purpose: Teach someone to develop and operate a cloud application.

Goals:

* Understand cloud and differences from pre-existing things
* Understand how to develop and how development changes with cloud
* Understand how to maintain many small distributed applications in a working
  cloud system



Cloud applications are distributed; otherwise, why cloud?  Why use the largest
dynamic infrastructure in the world if you're not taking advantage of what it
has to offer?  Within this "tome," we walk someone through the process of 
developing and operating a cloud application.  Not just a distributed or
parallel application of the last generation but an application native to today's
shifting infrastructure.



The content ahead, outlines and walks one through all of the stages of
cloud understanding and application creation and maintenance.  It is broken
down into four primary parts:

#. history and background of cloud computing
#. developing applications for the cloud
#. running and operating those applications in the cloud
#. everything else

Throughout, the concepts of agile development and DevOps are interjected as
appropriate to expound upon their roles in the cloud revolution.  They are
indirect focii of this document and do not fit into the natural progression of
the material at hand.
