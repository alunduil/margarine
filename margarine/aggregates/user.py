"""Interaction code for information about the User aggregate.

The data schema we're starting with is simple and could potentially be moved
to a key-value datastore with pickling as a marshalling technique.

The properties we're starting with are the following:

    * uuid4 (uuid5 username namespace?)
    * username
    * email
    * name
    * password â†’ md5(username:realm:password)
